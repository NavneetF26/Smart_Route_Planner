# Smart_Route_Planner

Our project, "Railway Route Optimization System," is a web-based tool designed to compute the most optimal train route between stations. Users input a start and destination station, and choose to optimize by distance, time, or cost. The system uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the best path based on the selected criteria. All computations are done in-browser using JavaScript, with station and route data embedded directly in JS files. The application has a clean, form-based HTML interface that ensures smooth user interaction without the need for a backend or database.
